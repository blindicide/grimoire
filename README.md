Useful little stuff for your git and bash things.

You might be wondering why it's called GRIMOIRE - well, I don't know either.

### The scripts in this repository:
* LIGHTSHOW - goes through every directory recursively and creates a file called "placeholder.txt" with "SAMPLE TEXT" in it, so git would see that folder. You can change the file content via -t and the name by editing the file itself.

* TELETYPE - adds all the files (except .gitignore, obviously), makes a commit message with the current date and time, and pushes it. Helpful for small changes.
